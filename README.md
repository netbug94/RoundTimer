At RoundTimer, we respect your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines what information we collect, how we use it, and how we protect your data when you use the RoundTimer application.

    Information We Collect

    RoundTimer does not collect any personal information from users. The only information we may access is any data that Google, Samsung Galaxy Store, or F-Droid collect when you download or install the app from their respective platforms.

    The only information we receive directly is any data you voluntarily send to us via email at netbug94@gmail.com, such as feedback, bug reports, or support inquiries.

    Use of Information

    Since we do not collect any data within the app itself, we do not process or store any personal information. Any information sent via email will only be used to respond to your inquiries or improve the app.

    Third-Party Services

    The RoundTimer app does not use any third-party services that collect data directly from the app. However, when downloading the app from the Google Play Store, Samsung Galaxy Store, or F-Droid, the respective store may collect information related to your usage and installation. For more details, please refer to the privacy policies of these platforms:

    Email Communications

    If you contact us via email at netbug94@gmail.com, any information you provide in your email (such as your name or email address) will only be used to respond to your questions or improve the app. We do not share this information with any third parties.

    Security

    Since RoundTimer does not collect any personal data from users directly, there is minimal risk of data breaches. However, if you contact us via email, we take reasonable precautions to protect the information shared through email communications.
